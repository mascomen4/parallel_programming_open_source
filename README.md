# PFUR Open Source Fortran Parallel Programming Course

Hi! This a collaborative repository for solving Parallel Programming problems.   

**Before you start, if you have an installed virtual machine, I would really recommend to run linux ubuntu in the virtual machine and use gfortran from there.**

### Labs progress:
1. task1, task2 are done. Task3 and task4 remains
2. x
3. x
4. x

### Prerequests:
1. Miniconda or Anaconda distribution: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
2. Compiler: GFortran. Linux Ubuntu installation: ``` sudo apt install gfortran ```, but first check if it's already installed ``` which gfortran ```
2. IDE: CLion (you can claim it having a student status) or refer to this https://www.google.com/search?q=fortran+ide&oq=for&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j69i61l2j69i65l3j69i60.4559j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
3. For CLion Fortran plugin refer here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/fortran-support.html


### Usage:

IMPORTANT: *lab01* directory is out of date. Please, use *lab01_new* for the first lab

- ``` git clone git@github.com:mascomen4/parallel_programming_open_source.git ```
- Then in your IDE open the project, choose **main** function from any ex. in configurations and run it. For example, choose **main_ex2** to run the tests on ex2.f90 fortran file.

*For sure, you can compile the ex. in the bash. In that case I suggest you know what u're doing, so u don't need any explanations.*

- TODO: Exlain how to run the exs.
