Hi! This a collaborative repository for solving Parallel Programming problems. 

1. Compiler: GFortran. Linux Ubuntu installation: ``` sudo apt install gfortran ```, but first check if it's already installed ``` which gfortran ```
2. IDE: CLion (you can claim it having a student status) or refer to this https://www.google.com/search?q=fortran+ide&oq=for&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j69i61l2j69i65l3j69i60.4559j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

- Alternatively ``` gfortran main.f90 ```  

- To test the work of any exercise, paste the code from (example) ``` lab01/test/test_quicksort.f90 ``` to ``` main.f90 ```, and paste the correct ``` include ``` statement at the top of program.

- Test code is in *test/*  folder. Source code is in *src/*  folder
