# PFUR Open Source Fortran Parallel Programming Course

### Abstract
IMPORTANT: *lab01* directory is out of date. Please, use *lab01_new* for the first lab  

Note: First line of each file consists of something like `! Created by ivan on 10.09.2021.`. Please, do remember to remove that line if you want to test
the project on your own.  
Note: Please, refer to branch `develop` for the most recent updates 

For sure, you can compile the ex. in the bash. In that case I suggest you know what u're doing, so u don't need any explanations.

# Prerequisites:
1. Miniconda or Anaconda distribution: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html for plotting data in ex1. 
2. Compiler: GFortran. Linux Ubuntu installation: ``` sudo apt install gfortran ```, but first check if it's already installed ``` which gfortran ```
2. IDE: CLion (you can claim the license having a student status)
3. For CLion Fortran plugin refer here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/fortran-support.html


# Usage:

- ``` git clone git@github.com:mascomen4/parallel_programming_open_source.git ```
- Then in your IDE open the project, choose any **main** function from any exercise in configurations and run it. For example, choose **main_ex3** to run the tests over the ex2.f90 fortran file.
- Each exercise consists of some number of points. Fer every point I made the `main` file, so you can easily select&run it.
