# PFUR Open Source Fortran Parallel Programming Course

Hi! This a collaborative repository for solving Parallel Programming problems.   

**Before you start, if you have an installed virtual machine, I would really recommend to run linux ubuntu in the virtual machine and use gfortran from there.**

### Labs progress:
1. task1, task2 are done. Task3 and task4 remains
2. x
3. x
4. x

### Prerequests:
1. Miniconda or Anaconda distribution 
2. Compiler: GFortran. Linux Ubuntu installation: ``` sudo apt install gfortran ```, but first check if it's already installed ``` which gfortran ```
2. IDE: CLion (you can claim it having a student status) or refer to this https://www.google.com/search?q=fortran+ide&oq=for&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j69i61l2j69i65l3j69i60.4559j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
3. For CLion Fortran plugin refer here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/fortran-support.html


### Usage:

IMPORTANT: *lab01* directory is out of date. Please, use *lab01_new* for the first lab

- ``` git clone git@github.com:mascomen4/parallel_programming_open_source.git ```, then in your IDE open the projecct. I suggest to use CLion with GFortran plugin.

- Alternatively ``` gfortran main.f90 ```  

- To test the work of any exercise, paste the code from (example) ``` lab01/test/test_quicksort.f90 ``` to ``` main.f90 ```, and paste the correct ``` include ``` statement at the top of program.

- Test code is in *test/*  folder. Source code is in *src/*  folder
