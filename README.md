# PFUR Open Source Fortran Parallel Programming Course

Hi! This a collaborative repository for solving Parallel Programming problems.   

**Before you start, if you have an installed virtual machine, I would really recommend to run linux ubuntu in the virtual machine and use gfortran from there.**

### Labs progress:

### Prerequests:
1. Miniconda or Anaconda distribution: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
2. Compiler: GFortran. Linux Ubuntu installation: ``` sudo apt install gfortran ```, but first check if it's already installed ``` which gfortran ```
2. IDE: CLion (you can claim it having a student status) or refer to this https://www.google.com/search?q=fortran+ide&oq=for&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j69i61l2j69i65l3j69i60.4559j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
3. For CLion Fortran plugin refer here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/fortran-support.html


### Usage:

IMPORTANT: *lab01* directory is out of date. Please, use *lab01_new* for the first lab

- ``` git clone git@github.com:mascomen4/parallel_programming_open_source.git ```
- Then in your IDE open the project, choose **main** function from any exercise in configurations and run it. For example, choose **main_ex2** to run the tests over the ex2.f90 fortran file.
- ONLY FOR EXERCISE 1: Additionaly, in the main.f90 files you'll find the blocks of code marked as ```FOR POINT X```. You can uncomment this block of code, and comment the rest of code, leaving the variables declarations. In that case you'll be able to see the work done on the previous points during the exercise.

### For sure, you can compile the ex. in the bash. In that case I suggest you know what u're doing, so u don't need any explanations.
